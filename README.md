# ROKerbalism

### WARNING: THIS MOD IS STANDALONE! IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL IT, UNINSTALL EVERY OTHER VERSION OF KERBALISM!

#### Spin-off of Kerbalism (https://github.com/steamp0rt/Kerbalism) made to work for Realism Overhaul. Its main focus is on RP-1 integration, so that's what most of the configs are made for.

*Why would I install it?*

Kerbalism allows a much more in-depth simulation of crewed AND uncrewed missions. You'll now have to deal with radiation, stress and hard drives, and much more. For more info, read the official kerbalism documentation [here](https://kerbalism.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
If you're used to TAC-LS, this is way more realistic and won't allow you to make a manned Jupiter mission in a Mercury capsule without your astronaut going crazy. The radiation model is still not perfect and it will be a problem only on really long missions, but mind your shielding.

If you're used to stock Kerbalism, this is still pretty different. Reliability and weather features are disabled, for the moment, but spacecrafts aren't customizable unless you use advanced near-future planetary habitats. Almost all historical parts have been given their real life support systems and recycling didn't come until the ISS era.

If you're also playing RP-1, congratulations! You'll get a bunch of features that weren't previously possible. Thanks to the new features that will be introduced with Kerbalism 3.0, all experiments now take time (needs HEAVY balancing); you can unlock life support subsystems and you can place them on old capsules to improve them. You'll also progress through various technologies that will reduce the weight of your life support system by a considreable amount, making crewed interplanetary more rewarding on the planning and progression side. More work is still needed for ISRU and recycling, though.

Until RealAntennas is completed, ROKerbalism will have to rely on the unrealistic stock CommNet. It never had a perfect configuration, so transmission will probably be somewhat broken.

Supported mods:

- Ven's stock revamp
- FASA
- ROCapsules
- SXT
- CxAerospace
- RN Soyuz
- RN US Probes (partial)
- Bluedog Design Bureau (partial)
- More to come!
