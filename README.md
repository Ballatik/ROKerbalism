# ROKerbalism

#### Config for [Kerbalism](https://github.com/Kerbalism/Kerbalism) made to work for Realism Overhaul, with optional (and recommended) career integration through [RP-1](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0).

### Manual Installation

1. Use a new install (should work in any version currently supported by the official kerbalism core), or, arternatively, uninstall all other life support mods;

1. Install RealismOverhaul and its dependencies;

1. (Optional) Install RP-1 and its dependecies if you want to play in career;

1. Install Kerbalism (from anywhere you want) and KerbalismConfig from ROKerbalism.

*Why would I install it?*

Kerbalism allows a much more in-depth simulation of crewed AND uncrewed missions. You'll now have to deal with radiation, stress and hard drives, and much more. For more info, read the official kerbalism documentation [here](https://github.com/Kerbalism/Kerbalism/wiki).
If you're used to TAC-LS, this is way more realistic and won't allow you a crewed Jupiter mission in a Mercury capsule without your astronaut going crazy. You'll also have to worry about Cosmic Background Radiation and solar weather, so mind your shielding.

If you're used to stock Kerbalism, this is still pretty different. The Reliability feature is disabled, for the moment, but spacecrafts aren't customizable unless you use advanced near-future planetary habitats. Almost all historical parts have been given their real life support systems and recycling doesn't come until the ISS era.

If you're also playing RP-1, congratulations! You'll get a bunch of features that weren't previously possible. Thanks to the new features that will be introduced with Kerbalism 3.0, all experiments now take time; you can unlock life support subsystems and you can place them on old capsules to improve them. You'll also progress through various technologies that will reduce the weight of your life support system by a considreable amount, making crewed interplanetary more rewarding on the planning and progression side. More work is still needed for ISRU and recycling, though.

For ultimate realism, balance and performance, you'll want to install [RealAntennas](https://github.com/DRVeyl/RealAntennas). RemoteTech was never tested, but you're free to try it if you want.
